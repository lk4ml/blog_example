I consider myself a tinkerer and problem solver. I have a strong attachment to Linux and DIY mindset. My idea of a weekend project would be building and flying a drone or fixing up a Raspberry Pi with my home electricals!

Currently I am working on understanding JavaScript, React and Node. If you check [me out on GitHub](https://github.com/mbtamuli), you'll see me doing small projects.

I also like Golang and the occasional PHP. I run Chrome, VSCode and a few other tools I use as Docker containers just for fun!

If any of the above sounds interesting and you'd like chat, drop an email at **contact** at **mriyam** dot **dev**.

Thanks for reading.
