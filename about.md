I consider myself a tinkerer and problem solver. I have a strong attachment to Linux and DIY mindset. My idea of a weekend project would be building and flying a drone or fixing up a Raspberry Pi with my home electricals!

Currently I am working as a DevOps Engineer. My focus in on Golang and Kubernetes(administration as well as programming). If you check [me out on GitHub](https://github.com/mbtamuli), you'll see me doing small projects.

If any of the above sounds interesting and you'd like chat, drop an email at **contact** at **mriyam** dot **dev**.
