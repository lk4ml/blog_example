# Keeping a Notebook

I recently came across this [note](https://notebook.lachlanjc.me/2019-09-06_keeping_a_notebook/) and I could agree to all of the reasons mentioned for creating a Notebook. So here it is.

I have my set format though, I'll keep the name of the note as the date, and I'll put multiple headings to separate the different topics I write about on each day.

# Running node completely in Docker

I'm currently learning a few things about web development and although I am not learning NodeJS right now, I am using NodeJS to run and install stuff.

First of all, JavaScript. I'm focusing on vanilla JavaScript for now, but I am using the [delightful JavaScript Testing Framework Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Then while working on HTML and CSS, I like to use the package [http-server](https://github.com/http-party/http-server), to disable cache so I don't have to keep the Dev Tools open always to be able to see the latest uncached content.

For this reason, I require Node and NPM installed on my laptop, but I like to keep things isolated. I do know about Node Version Managers but it's my personal setup, so I will do however I please!

So I used this [Dockerfile](https://github.com/mbtamuli/dockerfiles/blob/master/node/Dockerfile) and a [few aliases](https://github.com/mbtamuli/dotfiles/blob/master/.zsh_aliases#L154-L162) to get all these commands to work directly from my host machine.
```bash
yarn test
npm install http-server -g
http-server -c-1
```
